#### Knowledge

R Basics

This is a quick example of a workflow working with data. It serves as a "carrot
on a stick" that will hopefully get you through the more tedious parts of
learning a programming language. If that doesn't work, here's a motivational
penguin:

## Installing tidyverse

The **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages that gives us an extensive toolkit for
working with data, from importing to transforming and visualising.

To install the tidyverse:

```{r}
#| label: install-tidyverse
#| eval: false
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

If you already installed **tidyverse**, doing this will just update
the package.

Now the package is installed on our system, we can load it with `library()`.
In [R basics](/docs/01_r-basics.qmd) we only worked in the console, so we have
no real overview
of what we've done. You can see previous commands by pressing the up arrow
<kbd>↑</kbd> on your keyboard, or look at the *.Rhistory* file, but a better way
of keeping a record of the steps we take is by working in an R script.

Create a new script

    File > New File > R Script

This will open a blank document. Here we can enter as many commands as we want to run.
Pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will no longer run the command. Instead, you can run a command
using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>. We can save the script (in *scripts/*) and
load it any time we want to see what we've done so far.

At the top of the script, load **tidyverse**.

```{r}
#| label: load-tidyverse
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
```


## Importing data

Usually we would use the `read_csv()` function to import a local *.csv* file, but we can also give it a url (as long as it points to a *.csv* file).

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(tidyverse)
sheep_data <- read_csv("https://edu.nl/3hru6")
```

Barring any issues, we should now have the data available in R.
A quick check with the `head()` function should allow us to see if
anything went wrong.

```{r}
head(sheep_data) # first 6 rows of the data
```

The data are from the publication:

## Visualising the data with ggplot2

First order of business is to explore the data set visually. To do that we will
use the **ggplot2** package, which is part of **tidyverse**.

For example, we could look at the relationship between the `GLl` and `Bd` measurements
of the specimens.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
sheep_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = GLl, y = Bd)) +
    geom_point(aes(col = Zone, shape = Zone), size = 2) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
    scale_colour_viridis_d(end = 0.8) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(
      x = "Greatest lateral length",
      y = "Breadth of distal end"
    )
```


The anatomy of a standard ggplot is:

```r
ggplot(data = <data>, aes(<mappings>)) +
    <geometric function> +
    <customisations>
```


To start creating a plot, we use the `ggplot()` function and provide our data
as the first argument.

```{r}
ggplot(data = sheep_data)
```

This gives us a blank canvas on which we can create our visual masterpiece. Right now,
however, all `ggplot()` knows is that we want to create a plot with our data, but that's
not enough information, and `ggplot()` isn't a mind-reader. We need to tell ggplot which
variables we want to plot by providing the `mapping` to the `aes`thetics of the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = sheep_data, mapping = aes(x = GLl, y = Bd))
```

By providing the mapping, `ggplot()` now knows the bounds of the variables that
we want to visualise, and can map the x and y aesthetics to our plot.
Our code is pretty long, so to make it readable (to humans) we can expand it
over multiple lines.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(
  data = sheep_data,
  mapping = aes(x = GLl, y = Bd)
)
```

Finally,
we need to define a `geom`etrical object to represent our data. For a scatter plot
the `geom` we need is `geom_point()`.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = sheep_data, 
  mapping = aes(x = GLl, y = Bd)
) +
  geom_point()
```

Already we can see a relationship between the `GLl` and `Bd` of our sheep.


### Adding aesthetics

We can now already see that there is a positive relationship between the variables
`GLl` and `Bd`. To take this relationship a step further, we can map a variable
to colour.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = sheep_data,
  mapping = aes(x = GLl, y = Bd, colour = Zone)
) +
  geom_point()
```

Now we can see the relationship (or lack thereof) in the measurements of sheep astragali
between the Zones
of occupation. To really drive home the relationship between the
variables we can add a curve with `geom_smooth()`. We want to see the linear relationship
so we will use `method = "lm"`.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = sheep_data,
  aes(x = GLl, y = Bd, colour = Zone)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

The confidence interval is making it kinda difficult to see the plot, so we can remove
them with `se = FALSE`.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = sheep_data,
  aes(x = GLl, y = Bd, colour = Zone)
) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

Because we are providing the colour mapping in the `ggplot()`, all `geom`s inherit
this value. If we just want to look at the overall relationship, we can move the
colour mapping to `geom_point()`, which will allow us to keep the `Phase` colours
and see the overall trendline for the data. We can reintroduce the confidence interval,
too.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = sheep_data,
  aes(x = GLl, y = Bd)
) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = Zone)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Now for some finishing touches. There are many reasons why only using colours to
convey information is a bad idea. Think about colour perception, and that publishers
charge you extra for colour printing. So let's make each `Phase` a different `shape`
as well.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = sheep_data,
  aes(x = GLl, y = Bd)
) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = Zone, shape = Zone)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Shapes can be resized using the `size` argument in the appropriate `geom`.
**Note** we don't want the size to be linked to an aesthetic, so we add the
argument outside of `aes()`.

```{r}
ggplot(
  sheep_data,
  aes(x = GLl, y = Bd)
) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = Zone, shape = Zone), size = 2) + # increase the size
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Then for the finishing touch, a new background and new axis labels.

```{r}
ggplot(
  sheep_data,
  aes(x = GLl, y = Bd)
) +
  geom_point(
    aes(colour = Zone, shape = Zone),
    size = 2
) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(end = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Greatest lateral length",
    y = "Breadth of distal end"
  )
```


## Data Transformation with {dplyr}

We can start working on our data frame to find additional relationships. This will
largely be done with functions from the tidyverse package [dplyr]{.pkg}.

### Transforming rows

The main functions used to operate on rows of a data frame are:

- `filter()`: filter rows based on a condition
- `arrange()`: arrange rows by ascending or descending values

Let's say we want to `filter` data that are related to the `Site` "KSN".

```{r}
filter(sheep_data, Site == "KSN")
```

Now say we're only interested in rows related to "KSN" and "ABM". That means we
want to filter all rows where `Site` is "KSN" or "ABM".

```{r}
filter(
  sheep_data,
  Site == "KSN" | # or
    Site == "ABM"
)
```

Or, in other words, we want all rows where the value of `Site` is **not**
"DOR".

```{r}
filtered_site <- filter(
  sheep_data,
  Site != "DOR"
)
```

What's going on under the hood when we use filter, is the condition we create
produces a Boolean vector that determines which rows should be kept.

```{r}
sheep_data$Site != "DOR"
```

Whenever a value is `TRUE`, that row will be retained, and whenever it is `FALSE`,
that row will be removed.

We can then arrange the data frame in ascending or descending order of `GLl`.

```{r}
arrange(filtered_site, GLl) # ascending
arrange(filtered_site, desc(GLl)) # descending
```

### Transforming columns

The most common functions for transforming columns are:

- `mutate`
- `select`

The `mutate` function allows us to add variables. These can be variables with
values that we define, or calculated from other variables. For example, we
could create a variable containing the name of the dataset:

```{r}
mutate(filtered_site, dataset = "Sheep Astragali")
```

Considering we only have this dataset, it's not that informative. Instead, we
could use the existing `GLl` and `Dl` variables to create a new variable
containing the dimension index `Dl` and `GLl` of a specimen, and add it `.after`
`Dl` in our data frame.

```{r}
dim_index <- mutate(
  filtered_site,
  Dl_GLl = Dl / GLl * 100, .after = Dl
)
```

### Pipes

We are starting to produce a lot of intermediate data frames, which will end up
taking up memory. Not a lot in this case, but if we were working with a large
dataset, it might not be insignificant.

The pipe, `|>` is an operator that allows us to string together
multiple functions/operations on the same data, without the need
to use the data argument in each step, and without the need to
create intermediate objects.

::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
## Choosing a pipe

As of R version 4.1.0, there are now two pipe operators. The 'native'
pipe, `|>` and the {magrittr} pipe, `%>%`. They are very similar but
differ in some key areas. For more information, see
[this blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/01/understanding-the-native-r-pipe-2/)
Here we will be using the native pipe since it doesn't require installing
additional packages (although {magrittr} is part of the tidyverse and many
packages import the magrittr pipe).
:::

To recreate the previous steps using the pipe:

```{r}
sheep_data |> # we take our data, and then
  filter(Site != "DOR") |> # filter, and then
  mutate(Dl_GLl = Dl / GLl * 100) # create a new variable
```

Think of the pipe as the phrase 'and then'.

![GIPHY](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbjJyZzZ3d3I4ZWhoYm9xcWc4am5kbXMzb294ZG45bzloN2k2Z21jOSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/bzaEWi1Z1xzby/giphy.gif)

First we take our data frame, and then we `filter()` on the `Site`
variable, and then we take the output (the data frame we originally
called `filtered_site`) from that operation
and pipe it to `.data` argument in the next `mutate()` operation to create the
new variable `Dl_GLl`. The output of these operations is the same as the `dim_index`
data frame.

The `select()` function allows us to... well, select columns of the data frame
that we want to keep (or not keep). We do this by providing the name(s) of the
column(s) we want to select.

```{r}
select(sheep_data, specID, Site, GLl, Dl)
```

We could also use the position of the columns:

```{r}
select(sheep_data, 1, 3, 7, 9)
```

Negating columns we don't want is possible, and may sometimes be the easier option.

```{r}
select(sheep_data, !c(Taxon, Zone, Period, group, Bd))
```

::: {.callout-warning}
```r
select(sheep_data, !Taxon, !Zone, !Period, !group, !Bd)
```

will not work as expected.

:::

Let's create a new, reduced data frame with the previous operations, and add an additional
variable with a dimension index for `Bd` and `Dl`.

```{r}
dimension_data <- sheep_data |>
  filter(Site != "DOR") |>
  select(specID, Site, GLl, Bd, Dl) |>
  mutate(
    Dl_GLl = Dl / GLl * 100,
    Bd_Dl = Bd / Dl * 100
    )
```

### Grouping and summarising data

In many situations you'll want to summarise data and calculate summary statistics
for different groups. The [dplyr]{.pkg} functions `summarise`/`summarize` and `group_by`
will help you do that.

```{r}
dimension_data |>
  group_by(Site)
```

::: {.callout-caution}
## Linebreaks

You can't just create a linebreak anywhere in your code. It should
come after certain operators and symbols. It should come after the
`+` symbol in a ggplot and after a pipe. The following will not work:

```{r}
#| label: bad-linebreak
#| eval: false
dimension_data 
|>  group_by(Zone)
```

:::

You will likely not have noticed any difference in this data frame, but if you
look at the top where the description is, you will see that it is now
`A tibble: 107 x 7` with `Groups: Site [2]`. This means that the tibble (or data
frame) is grouped by the variable `Site` which has two groupings.

Once a data frame is grouped, we can perform specific operations on those groups,
like calculating summary statistics.

```{r}
dimension_data |>
  group_by(Site) |>
  summarise(
    mean_Dl_GLl = mean(Dl_GLl)
  )
```

This calculates the mean area for each group. We can add multiple arguments to
`summarise()` to get the `s`tandard `d`eviation and `n`umber of rows in each
group:

```{r}
dimension_data |>
  group_by(Site) |>
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_Dl_GLl = mean(Dl_GLl),
    sd_DL_GLl = sd(Dl_GLl)
  )
```

We can also visualise this with a box plot.

```{r}
dimension_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Site, y = Dl_GLl)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

Box plots are notorious for hiding the distribution of data, so let's add a violin plot
with `geom_violin()` **behind** the box plots. If you're lucky, sometimes the violin plots
will look like pots. If you're even luckier, the pot-like plots will be of data from actual pots!

```{r}
dimension_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Site, y = Dl_GLl)) +
    geom_violin() + # will be displayed behind the box plots
    geom_boxplot()    
```

The box plots are a little big, making it hard to see the violin plots behind them.
We can use the `width` argument to adjust the width of the boxes.

```{r}
dimension_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Site, y = Dl_GLl)) +
    geom_violin() +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)
```

Add some colour to the violins to contrast the two plot types, and change the background,

```{r}
dimension_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Site, y = Dl_GLl)) +
    geom_violin(aes(fill = Site)) +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.2) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") # and remove the redundant legend
```

et violà!

This masterpiece should be saved.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggsave("figures/my-first-plot.png")
```

This is a pretty idealised situation where the data are in a useable format. Real
world data are rarely this easy to work with. I also removed the missing data
from the example dataset. Hardly representative of a real-world archaeological
dataset...
