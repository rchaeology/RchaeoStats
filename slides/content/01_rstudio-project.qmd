## RStudio Project {.smaller}

The best way to organise a project is using an RStudio Project.

An RStudio Project creates a self-contained, portable project.

It makes working with file paths easier

No more absolute file paths using `setwd()`, that will break
on any other computer.

File paths only need to be relative to the project root.
