## Course overview

The teaching materials on this site are intended for teaching Statistics and R programming workshops
to archaeologists.

This course follows the [tidyverse philosophy](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro#what-you-will-learn)
of understanding and analysing your data through a repeated cycle of transforming,
visualising, and modelling.

## Course modules

The course contains multiple modules that can be used to construct
workshops of varying durations and customised to suit the participants' needs.

The core module contains an introduction to R and RStudio, an example workflow, and
data import and cleaning.

- Reproducible Research
- Topic-specific modules
  + Skeletal age-at-death and sex estimation
  + Radiocarbon dating
  + Dendrochronology
  + etc.


## Course outcomes

Understand enough to explore more on your own and be able to solve the
issues you run into. Because you will run into issues. Everyone runs into issues.
It's VERY satisfying once you have solved them, though.
